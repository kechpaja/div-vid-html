Single-character tags, as well as the double-character tag "dd", have been
replaced with new, non-palidromic tags: `an, bo, df, it, par, qu, st, un` in 
place of original `a b dd i p q s u`. 

The tags "dt" and "rt" have been replaced with "ddt" and "rbt" to avoid
collisions with reversed versions of "td" and "tr".
